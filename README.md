## Usage

Register service and add permission to AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<service android:name="io.inway.ringtone.player.FlutterRingtonePlayerService"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
```

Add following import to your code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ringtone_player/flutter_ringtone_player.dart';
```

Then simply call this to play system default notification sound:

```dart
FlutterRingtonePlayer.playNotification();
```

There's also this generic method allowing you to specify in detail what kind of ringtone should be played:

```dart
FlutterRingtonePlayer.play(
  android: AndroidSounds.notification,
  ios: IosSounds.glass,
  looping: true, // Android only - API >= 28
  volume: 0.1, // Android only - API >= 28
  asAlarm: false, // Android only - all APIs
);
```  

Also you can specify a custom ringtone from assets that works for both Android and iOS:
```dart
FlutterRingtonePlayer.play(fromAsset: "assets/ringtone.wav");  
```  

You can specify a platform specific ringtone and it will override the one from assets:
```dart
FlutterRingtonePlayer.play(  
 fromAsset: "assets/ringtone.wav", // will be the sound on Android
 ios: IosSounds.glass 			   // will be the sound on iOS
 );  
```

### .play*() optional attributes

| Attribute       |  Description |
| --------------  | ------------ |
| `bool` looping  | Enables looping of ringtone. Requires `FlutterRingtonePlayer.stop();` to stop ringing. |
| `double` volume | Sets ringtone volume in range 0 to 1.0. |
| `bool` asAlarm  | Allows to ignore device's silent/vibration mode and play given sound anyway. Because this will run the service in foreground you also have to set `alarmNotificationMeta`. |
| `AlarmNotificationMeta` alarmNotificationMeta  | Sets further attributes for the alarm notification which will be created if the sound will be played as alarm. |


To stop looped ringtone please use:

```dart
FlutterRingtonePlayer.stop();
```

Above works only on Android, and please note that by default Alarm & Ringtone sounds are looped.

## Default sounds

| Method           | Android | iOS |
| ---------------- | ------- | --- |
| playAlarm        | [RingtoneManager.TYPE_ALARM](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/RingtoneManager#TYPE_ALARM) | IosSounds.alarm |
| playNotification | [RingtoneManager.TYPE_NOTIFICATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/RingtoneManager#TYPE_NOTIFICATION) | IosSounds.triTone |
| playRingtone     | [RingtoneManager.TYPE_RINGTONE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/RingtoneManager#TYPE_RINGTONE) | IosSounds.electronic |

### Note on iOS sounds

If you want to use any other sound on iOS you can always specify a valid Sound ID and manually construct [IosSound]:

```dart
FlutterRingtonePlayer.play(
  android: AndroidSounds.notification,
  ios: const IosSound(1023),
  looping: true,
  volume: 0.1,
);
```
